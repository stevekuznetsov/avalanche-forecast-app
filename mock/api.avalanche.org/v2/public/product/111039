    "bottom_line": "<p>The avalanche danger will be minimal in the morning and will quickly spike as temperatures warm and the sun melts the surface snow. Wet avalanches will likely occur as the day warms and they could be big enough to bury or kill you. Plan your travel to stay out from under cornices and to be off of sunny slopes before wet avalanche activity begins.</p>",
    "hazard_discussion": "<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">On Saturday, observers in the Silver Star drainage reported the previously cold snow on northerly aspects near and above treeline was quickly warming. Rock faces were shedding snow, (see photo below) and slopes above treeline had lightly wind-affected surfaces. It's likely that in more sun-exposed terrain, wet avalanches may have occured. On Thursday, I found a wide range of <a href=\"https://nwac.us/pro-obs/20220421_silver-star-creek/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">conditions</a>, also in Silver Star from dry ground on low elevation, south-facing slopes to cold, winter-like snowpack on north-facing slopes in the alpine. I found 4-7\" of new snow and up to 2ft of recent snow over a crust from April 8th. We saw and heard about 5<a href=\"https://nwac.us/avalanches/20220421_silver-star-creek/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> loose wet avalanches</a> off steep, rocky west-facing slopes before noon with the warming temperatures. Some of these were large (D1.5). No wind slabs were found. Elsewhere, the wind may have formed more significant slabs. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Information and observations have been limited. The North Cascades Highway SR 20 is currently gated at Silverstar, though the road is plowed further west. Until the road opens, WSDOT allows recreational access on the North Cascades Highway near Washington Pass from Friday-Sunday. With road clearing operations underway midweek and other professional operations inactive, any observations are much appreciated. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><em>This is NWAC&rsquo;s last daily avalanche forecast for the 2021-2022 winter season.
